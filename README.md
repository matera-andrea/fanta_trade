# Fantasy Trade Manager

A web application for managing fantasy football trades, built with **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **TypeScript**.

## Overview
This project was developed for fun, with the goal of experimenting with a realistic web architecture and maintaining a good level of code accuracy and organization.  
It is not a complete product, but it includes most of the core features needed to manage teams, players, and trade interactions within a small private fantasy league.

## Features
- User authentication
- Team and player management
- Trade management with multiple states
- Basic admin dashboard with logging
- Prisma-based database
- Type-safe backend using Zod for validation

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Authentication:** Basic custom implementation


## Notes
This project was created for a small fantasy football group (fewer than 100 users).  
Although it is not intended as a production system, care has been taken to ensure clean architecture and data consistency.
